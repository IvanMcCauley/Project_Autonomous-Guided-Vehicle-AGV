# Project_Autonomous-Guided-Vehicle-AGV
A manually fabricated and coded line-following vehicle developed as a team during my first-year of Mechatronics Engineering. This AGV was designed to navigate a predefined course using optical sensors and complete 4 point turns. It was one of my first hands-on experiences integrating mechanics, electronics, and embedded programming.
